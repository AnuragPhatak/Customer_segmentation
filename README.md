# 📊 Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using a retail dataset, featuring analysis through **Feature Engineering**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) Analysis**, and **K-Means Clustering**.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🔍 Feature Engineering
- Extracted additional date-related features like **year**, **month**, **day**, **hour**, and **minute** from the `InvoiceDate` column.
- Created new features for **Month** and **time_of_day** to gain insights into **customer purchase patterns**.

### 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed **top products**, **frequent customers**, and **country distribution**.
- Visualized **monthly** and **daily sales patterns** to understand **seasonality** and **customer behavior**.

### 📊 RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis
- **Recency**: Number of days since the last purchase.
- **Frequency**: Count of purchases made by a customer.
- **Monetary**: Total amount spent by a customer.
- Customers are segmented based on their **RFM score** into **Platinum**, **Gold**, **Silver**, and **Bronze**.

### 🔵 K-Means Clustering
- Applied the **Elbow Method** on **Recency** and **Monetary** features to identify optimal clusters.
- Segmented customers based on **spending patterns** and **purchase recency**, supporting **targeted marketing strategies**.

## 🎉 Results

- **Top Products**: Identified best-selling items based on purchase frequency.
- **Customer Segments**: Grouped customers into segments for strategic marketing.
- **RFM Analysis**: Provides insights into **customer loyalty** and **value**.
